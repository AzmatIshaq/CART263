# Slamina New Game Plus!

by Azmat Ishaq

This is a coding exercise project for CART263 at Concordia University.

The original code was written by Professor Pippin Barr.

It is essentially a guessing game involving voice feedback from the user.
The user will need a microphone and the browser also needs to be able to work with ResponsiveVoice and annyang.

I added some more features to the code such as character animation, a scorekeeper, background color changing, and others.
