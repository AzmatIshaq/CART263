# Exercise 1 - Where is Sausage Dog New Game Plus!

By Azmat Ishaq

Expanded on original code from Pippin Barr's Sausage Dog Activitiy on Github:
https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263/tree/main/examples/p5js/wheres-sausage-dog

The objective of the game is to find the Sausage Dog!
This code displays a bunch of animals on screen. The players needs to find the
Sausage Dog animal in order to win!

I added multiple effects in the New Game Plus! version such as multiple game states, sounds, movement, visual effects, etc!

The effect for the rain is based on this p5 code: https://editor.p5js.org/kelsierose94/sketches/MU2Y21aG0

The countdown timer is based on this p5 code: https://editor.p5js.org/marynotari/sketches/S1T2ZTMp-

The sound for the incorrect alert came from this Text to Speech website: https://ttsmp3.com/
