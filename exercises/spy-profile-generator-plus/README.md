# Spy profile Generator Plus!
by Azmat Ishaq
Based on Pippin Barr's original code "Spy Profile Generator"

Originally "Asks the user for their name and generates a spy profile for them! Uses
JSON data to create the profile. Generates a password and requires that
password to view the profile when the program is loaded again." - Pipping Barr

I added additional JSON profile information. I also added user interaction to move
to animation as well as keyboard input. The user now has to defuse a bomb in the
animation state by inputting more JSON produced information.
