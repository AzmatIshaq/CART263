# Code Taker Plus Plus

Code Taker Plus Plus by Azmat Ishaq

Based on code by Pippin Barr:
  "The user can uncover secret letters in the poem by mousing over them. Once found
  they can drag the letters in the correct order to the answer area to find the name of an amazing instrument (the theremin) and receive congratulations."

I altered it to words instead of letters. The words also now have to be discovered by hovering over them. A dialogue modal was also added at the beginning. There are also hints and encouragements which utilize alerts and Jquery dialogue boxes.
