    "prelude": "I've been in this prison for 4 years. I'm done here. It's time for a change. Either I break out, or die trying. Ever since I got here, I stuck to myself writing in my cell. It reminded the other inmates of Ted Kaczynski, so they started calling me 'Teddy'. I'm done with that. No more holes, no more writing, no more Teddy. If I want to get out of here, it's time to make some moves. I've started a trading business so I can get the tools I need to break out of this hell. When they let me out of the hole today, I'm never looking back.",

        "warden": "Oh and Mosely. Trading is a dangerous business. You have 15 years left on your sentence, if you keep out of trouble, you can make it out safely. Keep that in mind.\n\nNow get back to your cell."
