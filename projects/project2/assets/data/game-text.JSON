    "prelude": "I've been in this prison for 4 years now. I'm done here. It's time for a change. Either I break out, or die trying. Ever since I got here, I stuck to myself writing in my cell. It reminded the other prisoners of Ted Kaczynski so they started calling me 'Teddy'. I'm done with that. No more holes, no more writing, no more Teddy. If I want to get out of here It's time to make some moves. I'm gonna start a trading business so I can get the tools I need to break out of this hell.",
