Artist Statement:

The idea for this project was to explore the use of annyang, responsive voice, and JSON. I did this by emulating an interrogation scene from the movie I-Robot. I chose this scene because it seemed like it would allow me to utilize annyang and responsive voice together creatively.

This was my first time attempting to program a story based experience and I believe I managed to simulate a conversation with a robot fairly well. In order to accomplish this I utilized the user's spoken input with annyang to trigger the responsive voice dialogue. Furthermore, I used JSON to store all of the dialogue input and output data. The game also utilizes states which are labelled as "scenes" and those are also switched between based on user input and time triggers. The time triggers utilize setTimeout with anonymous functions and I am glad they worked out because it allowed me to utilize code we learned this semester.

One of the issues I did run into was deciding where to put certain code. Some code had to be split between the setup() and draw() functions, especially in regards to triggers and audio elements. Sometimes I found a solution or a work around, however, other times it proved to be beyond my capabilities. I look forward to improving in that area of programming so that I can handle those kinds of issues with ease in the future. Another issue was that I had to rewrite a lot of the annyang data every time I switched scenes. Although it was satisfactory, there may be a better way that could have been done.

As for the storyline, I mashed different elements from the movie together and also added my own dialogue and creative input where it made sense. By studying some scenes from the movie I think I managed to combine these different elements together to produce a coherent and engaging experience.
